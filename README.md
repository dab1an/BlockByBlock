## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize

- **Description:** Block by Block is a gamified habit tracker that helps users stay consistent by visualizing their progress as a Minecraft-inspired world. Each day a user completes their habits, they earn XP that fills their progress bar and upgrades their “block” evolving from dirt to diamond. The app rewards consistency through item progression, streaks, and level-ups, making personal growth feel like leveling up in a game.
 - **Category:** Health & Fitness / Productivity
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to purchase goods from the student store and other rewards. The camera is used to share images with parents.
   - **Story:** The app turns habit-building into a creative and rewarding experience. Users “mine” their way through consistency — starting with dirt and gradually unlocking stronger materials like cobblestone, iron, gold, and diamond. A calendar view provides feedback on daily completions, while a limited “lives” system (similar to Duolingo) keeps users accountable. It encourages personal progress one block at a time, making growth visual, fun, and rewarding.
   - **Market:** Designed for students, young adults, and productivity enthusiasts who love Minecraft-style visuals and want a gamified way to stay motivated. The approachable style and progress-driven system appeal to people who find traditional trackers boring or hard to maintain.
   
   - **Habit:** Users interact daily — checking off habits, earning XP, and tracking streaks. The streak and “block evolution” mechanics encourage daily engagement. The app becomes part of the user’s daily rhythm, like checking in on a game.
   - **Scope:**
Core Features: V1: Dashboard- Habit creation, daily check-ins, XP progress bar, and material progression (dirt to diamond).

        V2: Calendar- Add a calendar view and “lives” system (three misses before reset).

        V3: Settings- Can edit personal information and other private information

        V4: Social leaderboard or friend challenges for shared motivation.
